# S.C.H.A.D Kafka Producer

Author G. Gordon	

## Overview

This project is a part of a larger project SCHAD created by GGordon.

It's aim is to retrieve clickstream data from a socket text stream, tranform this data into a pipe delimited string and publish to Apache Kafka

It will provide the following on each data event received

- Customer Id
- Product Viewed Id
- Customer Zip Code
- ScrollXPosition (X position in window)
- ScrollYPosition (Y position in window)
- Date Time

A sample line would look like (using `text` output format)
```
9515|965|57146|704.628|666.230|2020/05/20 01:35:50
```

It expects a json stream source - see https://github.com/gggordon/schad-clicksteam-generator

A sample line would look like (using `json` output format)
```
{"customerId":7869,"browser_y_position":1097.1743,"zipCode":28804,"browser_x_position":774.58954,"productId":1274,"date_time":"2020/05/18 15:31:05"}

## Acquiring a release

You may either build a release or use one of the pre-existing releases

### Pre-existing releases

Pre-existing releases are available in the `releases` folder and in another folder indicating their version. For eg. version `1.0.0` is available in `./releases/1.0.0`

### Building a release

This is an eclipse project managed by maven. 

1. You may either export the project from eclipse as a runnable jar
2. You may build a version using `mvn package`

## Running the application

You may either run the application directly or as a Docker Container.

### Running the application directly

```
java -jar schad-kafka-producer-1.0.0.jar --clickStreamServerAddress "0.0.0.0" --clickStreamServerPort "3005" --kafkaTopic schad --kafkaBootstrapServers "192.168.1.1:9092"
```

Where 
  - `schad-kafka-producer-1.0.0.jar` is the application name
  - `--clickStreamServerAddress` server address of clickstream data emitter source
  - `--clickStreamServerPort`  port used by clickstream data emitter
  - `--kafkaTopic`  kafka topics to publish to
  - `--kafkaBootstrapServers`  comma separated list of kafka bootstrap servers

docker build -t schad-kafka-producer .
docker run --name my-schad-kafka-producer schad-kafka-producer
```
